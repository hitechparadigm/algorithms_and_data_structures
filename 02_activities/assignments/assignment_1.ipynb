    "**Problem Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem requires us to identify numbers missing from a range [0, n] given a list of integers, where some integers in this range might be missing, and there could be duplicates. The solution needs to efficiently find and return the missing numbers or return -1 if none are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps in the Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Determine the Range:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To determine the upper limit n of the range, we use the maximum value in the list (max_val = max(lst)). This ensures that we are considering the entire possible range of numbers present in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove Duplicates for Efficient Lookup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using a set to store the list elements (set_lst = set(lst)) ensures that any duplicate numbers are removed, and lookups are efficient (average time complexity of O(1) for set operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Full Range Set:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By creating a set of all numbers from 0 to max_val (full_range_set = set(range(max_val + 1))), we establish the complete range of numbers that should be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find Missing Numbers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The difference between the full range set and the set of list elements (missing_numbers = full_range_set - set_lst) gives us the set of missing numbers. This operation is efficient because it leverages set difference, which is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convert to Sorted List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We convert the resulting set of missing numbers to a sorted list to provide the missing numbers in ascending order (missing_numbers_list = sorted(list(missing_numbers))).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Result:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If no numbers are missing (if not missing_numbers_list), we return -1. Otherwise, we return the sorted list of missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Works**\n",
    "1. Correct Range Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By using the maximum value in the list to determine the range, the solution correctly accounts for the full span of potential numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficiency with Sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Sets are used to handle duplicates and provide efficient look-up and difference operations. This ensures that the solution operates in linear time relative to the size of the input list, making it highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accurate Missing Number Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The set difference operation accurately identifies the missing numbers by subtracting the present numbers from the full expected range."
