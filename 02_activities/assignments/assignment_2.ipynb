    "##### Anwser\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided solution utilizes a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to detect duplicates in a binary tree. Let's break down the key components and logic of the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TreeNode Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This class defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, containing a value (val), and pointers to the left and right child nodes (left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. find_duplicate Function:\n",
    "    - This function serves as the entry point and sets up the initial conditions for the DFS traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. dfs Helper Function:\n",
    "    - A recursive function that performs the DFS traversal, checking for duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DFS Traversal:\n",
    "    -   The dfs function is defined to take a node and a set of visited values as arguments. The traversal starts from the root node and explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Base Case:\n",
    "    - If the current node (node) is None, the function returns -1, indicating no duplicate has been found in this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Duplicate Check:\n",
    "    - The function checks if the value of the current node (node.val) is already in the visited set. If it is, the function returns this value, as it is a duplicate.\n",
    "    - If the value is not in the visited set, it is added to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recursive Calls:\n",
    "    - The function recursively calls itself on the left child of the current node and stores the result in left_result.\n",
    "    -   If left_result is not -1, it indicates that a duplicate has been found in the left subtree, so the function returns this result immediately.\n",
    "    -   Otherwise, the function proceeds to recursively call itself on the right child of the current node and returns the result (right_result).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A set visited is initialized to keep track of the values of the nodes that have been visited during the traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Initial Call:\n",
    "    - The dfs function is initially called with the root node and the empty visited set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness:\n",
    "    - The solution correctly identifies duplicates by keeping track of visited node values in a set, ensuring that any value seen more than once is detected.\n",
    "    - By using DFS, the solution explores each node systematically, checking for duplicates in both left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The use of a set for tracking visited values ensures that the check for duplicates is efficient (O(1) average time complexity for lookups and inserts).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling Edge Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The base case where the node is None ensures that the function handles leaf nodes and empty trees gracefully.\n",
    "    -   The recursive structure ensures that the solution works for any binary tree, regardless of its shape or size.\n"

    "- For Assignment 1, the task was to solve a given coding problem from LeetCode. I was assigned the problem of finding the missing numbers in a list. My approach involved leveraging Python’s set operations to identify and return the missing numbers efficiently. I first determined the range by finding the maximum value in the list and then created a set of all numbers within this range. By calculating the difference between this set and the set of numbers from the list, I was able to identify the missing numbers. The solution was efficient with a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes. This assignment reinforced my understanding of set operations and their applications in solving algorithmic problems.\n",

By paraphrasing the problem, creating new examples, and explaining the solution’s time and space complexities, I deepened my understanding of tree traversal algorithms. Additionally, providing constructive feedback on the strengths and potential improvements of my partner's solution helped me dive deep into the solution and understanding of trees and tree search. "
